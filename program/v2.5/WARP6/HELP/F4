Basics of BBSing

Communicating with other people through bulletin boards is an exciting and
often entertaining hobby. But there are many pitfalls for the new and unwary.

When posting messages or even sending E-mail, you must be very careful to
ensure your meaning is clear. Words on a screen do not convey tone of voice
and method of delivery. Quite often people get into horrific arguments over
a little misunderstanding. Fortunately, an "emotional shorthand" has evolved to
help you convey mood and so on. For instance, this is a grin:

:)

If you look at it sideways you will see the two dots are the eyes and the
parenthesis is a smiling mouth. Along similar lines, you can simply type
"<Grin>" in your messages where appropriate.

Another thing you might notice is that in person, people are usually polite
and reserved, whereas online they are not so polite or reserved, and tend to
speak their opinions openly.

Finally, you should try to blend into any system you call. First observe how
other people do things and what kind of system it is, before posting a lot of
messages. An image comes to mind: "Bull in a china shop". Don't be one.
