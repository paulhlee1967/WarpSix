If there are any inaccuracies, please leave a E-mail for SYSOP. On your
first call, VERIFY THE SYSTEM'S EXISTENCE BY VOICE, i.e. make sure you call
during reasonable hours and hear a modem carrier on the other end.

If you advertise the phone number of any BBS, make sure your information
is accurate and up-to-date.
