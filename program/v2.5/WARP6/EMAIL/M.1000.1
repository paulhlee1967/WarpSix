Welcome to Warp Six BBS public domain version 2.5. I hope you will enjoy using
and modifying the system as much as I have in creating it. In many ways this
project has been a collaboration between myself and several Warp Six sysops
whose testing, suggestions and support have done much to improve the system.

It is to these individuals and the Apple II in general that this program is
dedicated.

Starting with PD version 2.0, Warp Six now has some support for  high speed
modems. Please be sure to read the "Read Me First", "Getting Started" and
"Modem Doc" files carefully. The answers to all your questions are in the
documentation. If you need help, please contact me by mail or E-mail.
