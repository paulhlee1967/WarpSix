Xmodem checksum is for old programs that don't support CRC.
Xmodem CRC is most prevalent and provides better error checking.
Xmodem 1K uses CRC and is faster due to its larger packet size.
Xmodem 4K uses CRC and is even faster for similar reasons. (Mainly Apple II)
Ymodem is for downloading more than one file at a time.

Compatibility notes:

Macintosh users should enable the MacBinary II on their communications
software before uploading or downloading. Mac users should say no to the
Binary II and ProDOS extensions.

Apple II users should use ProDOS or Binary II extensions. When uploading,
ProDOS is much preferred, as Binary II uploads will change the filename: if
the file is called TEST.BXY, tell the BBS to receive TEST.SHK.

Some Apple II programs (eg. Talk Is Cheap v3.09) don't like Xmodem 1K and 4K
uploading, but will send 1K or 4K if you just specify CRC when the BBS prompts
you for a protocol. Note: ProTERM 3 Ymodem ProDOS receive works great with
Warp Six BBS.
