Hello and welcome to the public domain release of Warp Six BBS. I hope you
enjoy using and modifying the system as much as I have creating it. This
new release (PD version 2.0) now supports high speed modems. Please be sure
to read the documentation carefully. All the answers to your questions are
there.

Sincerely,

Jim Ferr
