Welcome to Warp Six BBS public domain version 3.0. This update is dedicated to
Jim Ferr, all the sysops who have run Warp 6, Lon Seidman, Mike Whelan, and
the Apple II in general.

There is a list of new features and bug fixes in the NEW.FEATURES file in the
DOCS folder. The BIG change in v3.0 is the ability to put Warp 6 on the Net!

Please be sure to read the "Read Me First", "Getting Started" and "Modem
Doc" files carefully. The answers to all your questions are in the docs. If
you need help, please contact me by mail or E-mail.
