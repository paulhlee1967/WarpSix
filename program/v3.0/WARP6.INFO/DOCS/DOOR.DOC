Warp Six BBS, created by Jim Ferr
Frank Kucharski, and Scott Johnson.
Public domain version 3.0
November 1994.

    DOOR.LAUNCHER is a game menu and launcher for the Warp 6 BBS system.  Starting with version 3.0 it has been incorporated right into the BBS. 
The following files are needed for DOOR.LAUNCHER to function properly:

 - DOOR.LAUNCHER
 - DOOR.MENU or DOOR.MENU2 (the file must be named DOOR.MENU)
 - DOOR.DATA

    To deactivate DOOR.LAUNCHER, REM line 9950 in WARP6.BBS.
    To install games on Warp Six, all of your games must be in a folder of their own and each of those folders within the DOORS folder.  The name of each game folder is not as  important as the location.   You need to set the path where your door folder resides in SYS.DATA. The default is    DP$=" /HD1/WARP6/DOORS" .
    The DOOR.MENU file is the menu that is displayed to the user in DOOR.LAUNCHER.  DOOR.MENU2 is just a little fancier.  Choose the one you want and name it DOOR.MENU.  You must modify this menu so it contains a numbered menu of the games in your system.
    The DOOR.DATA file is the file which tells DOOR.LAUNCHER how many games you have, where your games are located, and how to run them.  The lines are defined as follows: 

 - The first line contains the number of door games you have installed.
 - Each line after that corresponds to a numbered menu choice. These lines are
    separated into 3 parts with asterisks (*).
        - The game folder's name
        - The filename of the program which starts the game
        - The line number to CHAIN to (usually 1000)

The default DOOR.DATA file is as follows:

1
BJ*BLACKJACK*1000


DOOR.LAUNCHER will return you to the BBS if line #1 is set to zero.  This is a nice feature to shut the games off temporarily.  You need to make the appropriate changes to the DOOR.DATA file and the DOOR.MENU file to fit your system before you can run your games.
    The door launcher has the capability to launch more than one game in succession without returning to Warp Six after each game.  To do this you need to modify the line in all of your door games where they quit back to Warp Six.  Change that line to be like the one shown below.  Instead of chaining back to WARP6.BBS as a game would normally do, set the prefix to DP$ and chain to DOOR.LAUNCHER at line 2000.  The following line assumes that "Q" is the game's quit command. The line number shown here is meaningless since the line could be anywhere in all the different games that are available.

10000 IF I$="Q" THEN PRINT D$;"PREFIX "DP$ : PRINT D$"CHAIN DOOR.LAUNCHER,@2000"

    This line will replace or modify the line your game normally quits with.  DOOR.LAUNCHER will report your users entering games, returning from them, and what time it was in the Warp Six DETAIL.LOG.  To disable this, put a REM statement at the beginning of lines 1105 and 2020 in DOOR.LAUNCHER.

This program is adapted directly from a public domain launcher by David D. Miller (just.dave on GEnie).  It is mostly his code.  I merely modified it to make it a little more verstile and changed the READ.ME file you are reading to reflect my modifications.  Jim Ferr also deserves credit for writing the Warp Six BBS system to begin with.  Portions of his code are included as well.
