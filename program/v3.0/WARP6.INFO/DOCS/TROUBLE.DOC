This file is intended to help you overcome typical problems, as they occur. If you encounter a problem not documented here, just remember that there is a logical explanation for every problem, if you can only find it. I have spent a lot of time debugging Warp Six software over the years, and most of the time I found bugs by thinking, rather than doing things like tracing and inserting break points.

Format: the question or problem is preceded by a greater than character (>).

If you find what you think is a bug, PLEASE report it to one of us so we can fix it. (See the Read.Me.First file for info on where/how to reach us.)

>System generates error first time it has been run, before installing live drivers.

Read Getting.Started section on "Setting up Pathnames".


>System beeps repeatedly and prints "Modem not responding!" (after live modem driver installed)

Possible causes: Modem not connected or turned on, wrong cable or card settings, or card in wrong slot. (Default is 2, set in beginning of LOGON. Cannot be changed with the IIGS driver.) Modem not fully Hayes compatible. Wrong driver selected. Missing or extra carriage returns in the Modem.Init file. Hit Control-C to exit the loop and re-read Modem.Doc.

>"Fatal error" after entering password, or logging off or entering commands.

Check the prefixes in the SYS.DATA file. See "Getting.Started" for details.

>System doesn't answer the phone

Modem not providing '2' result code (RING). Wrong driver installed (must support the fastest baud rate of the modem.) Is a "live" driver installed? Is your hardware supported? Is your modem fully Hayes compatible? Unless you have a normal 2400 baud modem, you must make a modification to a line in LOGON. (See "Getting.Started")

>System answers, but never connects or immediately hangs up

Modem not providing connect result code, or data carrier detect not being seen by the driver because you don't have a custom cable or possibly the cable you are using is incorrect for Warp Six BBS. (See Modem.Doc.) The &C1 command in the Modem.Init file may have been changed to &C0 by mistake. (This was an error in some older versions of Warp Six.) Similarly, your modem must provide an accurate indication of carrier detect. (See Modem.Doc.)

>Remote user gets garbage instead of valid data

Usually this indicates the wrong modem driver has been installed, or the remote user has not set his data format to 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity. Another explanation is a high speed modem is being used but the LOGON program has not been configured correctly. Check line 60 of LOGON to ensure your modem is going to either match the baud rate of the incoming call or maintain a fixed baud rate, defined in line 50 of LOGON. For info, see "Getting Started".

>A system error has occurred...

Use the Sysop Utilities to read the ERROR.LOG file, and check the Error Chart included with Warp Six BBS to determine the type of error that occurred. If you can't figure things out from there, load the program affected and list the line number where the error occurred. It is usually fairly obvious what went wrong. If you need assistance, contact one of the authors. The ERROR.LOG file is normal text, so you can read it with almost any word processor or the built-in TYPE command in Warp Six. If the error loops over and over, break out with Control-Reset, type "CLOSE" and press return to close any open files, then "TYPE /HD1/WARP6/LOGS/ERROR.LOG" (no quotes) to see the error log. (Modify the pathname accordingly if required.)

>Modem LEDs flash a lot

This is normal. Every 60 seconds the system checks to see the modem is still ready by sending the AT command. If there is no response, it tries to reset the modem. The frequency of these checks is adjustable. See Warp6.Doc "modifying system timeouts".

>When I logoff, the system doesn't hang up - I have to. If I leave it too long, the system starts looping with the message "Modem not responding!".
See the Modem.Doc file; your modem must be set to hangup and return to command state when DTR drops, or you must change LOGON to enable the Hayes hangup command -- which is the default as supplied. (See Getting.Started or Modem.Doc.) If you are using a IIGS, make sure you have the correct driver for your cable.

>Sysop commands like Open Apple-K (kill) or Open Apple-C (chat) ignored

Sysop commands are only active when there is no caller online, or when the caller is idle at a prompt. You can abort the TYPE command in progress (for example if the user is reading a text file) with the space-bar. To abort an Xmodem file transfer in progress hit the ESC key once, and wait for the current packet to finish. (This may take a few seconds, then the system will report "Transfer failed".)

>After leaving the system, I get a "PRODOS ERROR 01 RESTART" message.

You must use Open Apple-Q to quit Warp Six so the interrupt handler can be de-allocated by the software. Alternatively, you could write your own code to quit without exiting to ProDOS using the new M8 routine. (Eg. CALL M8. See "Warp6.Doc".)

>The software crashes on my computer.

Is your computer a genuine Apple product? Are you using the latest version of ProDOS and Basic.System? Although not strictly required, it is best to stay up to date, as later versions include bug fixes. If you have a patched version of ProDOS (to support a No Slot Clock, for example) don't worry about the version. Please let me know if the software crashes.

If you are launching from GS/OS, do you have anything weird installed that might steal interrupts or vertical blanking, eg. Twilight Screen Saver. If so, remove the suspect items and try the system again or boot directly from ProDOS 8.

>I called but the system call count didn't go up.

The system does not count Sysop calls in its call total for the system, nor does it count calls from unvalidated (new) users.

>My name never appears in the L)ast few callers, or there appears to be one name missing there.

Warp Six only logs sysop calls in the Detail log. The L)ast few callers command is only intended for end-users. Note that unvalidated users are not logged there either so that if one of them logged on with an obscene name, only the sysop would see it. Also, if someone calls twice in a row, his/her name is NOT duplicated in the Last few callers log.

>Every time I edit my own user record, the changes go away after I logoff. Same goes for the SYS.DATA file.

After saving changes to your own record or SYS.DATA, from Sysop utilities enter P for ProDOS command and type: "-LOGON" and hit Return. (No quotes). This will restart the system without re-writing the contents of these files from the variables in memory.

>I can't stop the program with Control-C.

To halt the program with Control-C, you may have to hit it several times. Most programs included in Warp Six will halt with "Sysop break". For obvious reasons, Control-C only works from the sysop keyboard. As well, if you are sitting idle at a prompt, Control-C will be ignored, because the modem driver is in control. Hit Control-C when a prompt is being printed, and you'll get a Break in line XXXX with the message "Sysop Break". You can use Control-Reset if you find Control-C inconvenient. After hitting Control-Reset, you should enter the CLOSE command to close any open files. (Actually, it's best you don't hit Control-Reset when a file is open, but Modem.Init is open when the system is trying to initialize the modem, for instance.) To return to the BBS after a Control-Reset, ensure you are in the root directory for your system and "-LOGON". (Don't hit control- Reset in the midst of disk access!)

>I keep getting END OF DATA errors. (Error code 5.)

Check your SYS.DATA file. Chances are it has been corrupted. Remove any commas or colons and check the fields against the structure listed in Getting.Started.
